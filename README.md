## This project contains several demos trying to access Github repositories programatically using the Github REST API

#### For the moment these are the following demo projects done (only reading public repositories):
* read-public-repo   on Spring
* github-rest-api-demos  on Quarkus


#### I can try to read in a similar way a private repository of an organization - TODO
